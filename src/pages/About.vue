          I have a background in computer and science. In 2019, I had a period
          of internship at Tencent. In the first project of the internship
          period, I was responsible for programming a cloud evaluation tool
          using the front-end React framework. Through this tool, customers can
          perform load and stress tests on their internet application.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-8 text-2xl">
          In the second project, I joined the QQ News team and was responsible
          for the back-end programming. In the project, I am responsible for
          refactoring C++ projects of the team in the Go language. For example,
          by adding and deleting different fields, I made the length and
          structure of the data packet sent by the client fit the Going
          framework used in the team, which enabled the server built with Go
          language to finally receive the data sent by the client built with
          C++.
